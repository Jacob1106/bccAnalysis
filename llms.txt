**Interactive ChIP-Seq peak analysis with Shiny: overlap detection, peak
annotation, width comparison, and visualization.**

## ✨ Features

- **Peak overlap analysis** with custom Venn diagrams
- **Peak annotation** using ChIPseeker + TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38
- **Width comparison** density plots
- **Export tables** (Excel) and plots (PDF)
- **Multi-sample filtering** by p-value and overlap count

## 🚀 Installation

Install: devtools::install_github(“YOURUSERNAME/bccAnalysis”)
